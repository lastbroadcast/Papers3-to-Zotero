# Papers3-to-Zotero
This script cleans up Papers3 export xml for import into Zotero

How to use:

*From Papers3, export as 'EndNote XML v8 or higher'

*Customise the script to make the modifications you want. For example:
-'%20' character changed to a space
-I was using Parallels to run Papers3, so I needed to remove a specific string from all path names
-several XML tags that are not recognised by Zotero are removed

*Run script

*Import into Zotero

All associated files (such as pdfs) should also transfer across. The collection/folder strucuture is lost in the transfer, but the script Papers3-to-Zotero_collections restores this.
